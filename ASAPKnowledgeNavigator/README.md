## Environment Variables

The following environment variables are required for proper configuration:

- `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`: Endpoint URI for Azure OpenAI services.
- `AZURE_OPENAI_KEY`: API key to authenticate Azure OpenAI services.
- `PHI_ENDPOINT`: Endpoint URI for the PHI service.
- `PHI_KEY`: API key for the PHI service.
- `AZURE_OPENAI_COMPLETION_DEPLOYMENT_NAME`: Deployment name for text completion service.
- `AZURE_OPENAI_EMBEDDING_DEPLOYMENT_NAME`: Deployment name for embedding service.
- `COSMOS_DB_CONNECTION_STRING`: Connection string for Azure Cosmos DB.
- `COSMOS_DB_DATABASE_ID`: Database ID in Cosmos DB.

### Exporting Environment Variables

Export these variables as follows:

```bash
export AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=<...>
export AZURE_OPENAI_KEY=<...>
export AZURE_OPENAI_COMPLETION_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=<...>
export AZURE_OPENAI_EMBEDDING_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=<...>
export PHI_ENDPOINT=<...>
export PHI_KEY=<...>
export COSMOS_DB_CONNECTION_STRING="<...>"
export COSMOS_DB_DATABASE_ID="<...>"
```

## Azure Resources Used

### 1. **Azure OpenAI Service**
   - **Purpose**: Natural language processing tasks (e.g., text completion, embeddings).
   - **Environment Variables**:
     - `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`
     - `AZURE_OPENAI_KEY`
     - `AZURE_OPENAI_COMPLETION_DEPLOYMENT_NAME`
     - `AZURE_OPENAI_EMBEDDING_DEPLOYMENT_NAME`

### 2. **Azure Cosmos DB**
   - **Purpose**: Storing globally distributed knowledge base data with multi-model capabilities.
   - **Configuration**:
     - Connection String: `COSMOS_DB_CONNECTION_STRING`
     - Database ID: `COSMOS_DB_DATABASE_ID`

### 3. **Azure Container Registry (ACR)**
   - **Purpose**: Stores container images for deployment.
   - Registry Name: acr-${resourceToken}
   - Role Assignment: Managed identity has the AcrPull role.

### 4. **Azure Container Apps Environment**
   - **Purpose**: Runs containerized applications using Azure Container Apps.
   - Configuration:
     - Workload Profile: Consumption type (optimized resource usage).
     - Log Analytics Integration enabled.

### 5. **Log Analytics Workspace**
   - Collects logs from various Azure services for monitoring and diagnostics.

### 6. **User Assigned Managed Identity**
   Provides secure authentication without embedding credentials in code.

## Initialization and Deployment

To initialize the app:

```bash
azd init
```

Follow prompts to configure the app (e.g., set environment name).

To provision and deploy the app:

```bash
azd up
```

Alternatively, use separate commands:

```bash
azd provision
azd deploy
```
