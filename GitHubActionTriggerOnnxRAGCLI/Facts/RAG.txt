RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with external data sources.
By retrieving relevant documents (facts), RAG systems can provide more accurate and contextually rich answers.
RAG can improve the reliability of AI-driven solutions like K8sLogBotRAG by leveraging domain-specific knowledge in real-time.
