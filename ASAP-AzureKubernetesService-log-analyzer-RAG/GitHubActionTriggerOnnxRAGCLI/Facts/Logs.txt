Logs are records of events that occur within systems and applications.
Kubernetes and AKS generate various logs: application logs, cluster logs, and system logs.
Log analysis helps identify issues, performance bottlenecks, and security incidents.
AI-driven log analysis can streamline troubleshooting, reduce time-to-resolution, and improve reliability.
