        <h2>Risks and Uncertainties </h2><br>

The following risks and uncertainties may affect Tesla's business, financial condition and operating results :

<ul><li><strong>Operational risks </strong>: including issues with lithium-ion cells or other components manufactured at Gigafactories, which may harm the production and profitability of vehicle and energy storage products. </li>
<li><strong>Intellectual property theft </strong>: including the risk of data breaches  and intellectual property theft , which could result in claims, litigation, regulatory investigations, significant liability and reputational damage. </li>
<li><strong>Fraud, extortion and harm to employees or customers </strong>: including the risk of fraud, extortion, harm to employees or customers and violation of data privacy or security laws. </li>
<li><strong>Cybersecurity risks </strong>: including the risk of cyber-attacks or other security incidents, which could result in data breaches, intellectual property theft, claims, litigation, regulatory investigations, significant liability, reputational damage and other adverse consequences. </li>
<li><strong>Electricity prices </strong>: decreases in the retail or wholesale prices of electricity from utilities or other renewable energy sources could make Tesla's products less attractive to customers and lead to an increased rate of customer defaults. </li>
<li><strong>Lithium-ion battery cell production </strong>: Tesla's plan to grow the volume and profitability of its vehicles and energy storage products depends on significant lithium-ion battery cell production, including by its partner Panasonic at Gigafactory Nevada. </li>
<li><strong>Data and inventory management </strong>: these risks may affect Tesla's ability to manage its data and inventory, procure parts or supplies or manufacture, sell, deliver and service products, adequately protect its intellectual property or achieve and maintain compliance with, or realize available benefits under, tax laws and other applicable regulations. </li>
<li><strong>Regulatory and safety requirements </strong>: Tesla's operations in various jurisdictions, particularly as a company based in the U.S., create risks relating to conforming its products to regulatory and safety requirements and charging and other electric infrastructures; organizing local operating entities; establishing, staffing and managing foreign business locations; attracting local customers; navigating foreign government taxes, regulations and permit requirements; enforceability of its contractual rights; trade restrictions, customs regulations, tariffs and price or exchange controls; and preferences in foreign nations for domestically manufactured products. </li>
<li><strong>Government laws and regulations </strong>: demand for Tesla's products and services may be impacted by the status of government and economic incentives supporting the development and adoption of such products. Government and economic incentives that support the development and adoption of electric vehicles in the U.S. and abroad, including certain tax exemptions, tax credits and rebates, may be reduced, eliminated, amended or exhausted from time to time. </li>
<li><strong>Common stock trading price </strong>: the trading price of Tesla's common stock is likely to continue to be volatile. The trading price of Tesla's common stock has been highly volatile and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond Tesla's control. </li>
<li><strong>International operations </strong>: Tesla faces risks associated with maintaining and expanding its international operations, including unfavorable and uncertain regulatory, political, economic, tax and labor conditions. Tesla is subject to legal and regulatory requirements, political uncertainty and social, environmental and economic conditions in numerous jurisdictions, including markets in which it generates significant sales, over which it has little control and which are inherently unpredictable. </li>
<li><strong>Employee retention </strong>: employees may leave Tesla or choose other employers over Tesla due to various factors, such as a very competitive labor market for talented individuals with automotive or technology experience, or any negative publicity related to Tesla. </li>
<li><strong>Foreign currency risks </strong>: Tesla transacts business globally in multiple currencies and has foreign currency risks related to its revenue, costs of revenue, operating expenses and localized subsidiary debt denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. </li>
<li><strong>Global market conditions </strong>: if Tesla experiences unfavorable global market conditions, or if it cannot or does not maintain operations at a scope that is commensurate with such conditions or is later required to or chooses to suspend such operations again, its business, prospects, financial condition and operating results may be harmed. Tesla faces strong competition for its products and services from a growing list of established and new competitors. </li>
<li><strong>Unauthorized access </strong>: reports of unauthorized access to Tesla's products, their systems or data, as well as other factors that may result in the perception that Tesla's products, their systems or data are capable of being hacked, may harm Tesla's brand, prospects and operating results. </li>
<li><strong>Supplier dependency </strong>: Tesla is dependent on its suppliers, including single source suppliers, and the inability of these suppliers to deliver necessary components of its products in a timely manner at prices, quality levels and volumes acceptable to Tesla, or Tesla's inability to efficiently manage these components from these suppliers, could have a material adverse effect on Tesla's business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. </li>
<li><strong>Product recalls </strong>: as a manufacturing company, Tesla must manage the risk of product recalls with respect to its products. Any work stoppages or strikes organized by such unions could delay the manufacture and sale of Tesla's products and may harm Tesla's business and operating results. Tesla may choose to or be compelled to undertake product recalls or take other similar actions. </li>
<li><strong>New manufacturing operations </strong>: Tesla is subject to a number of uncertainties inherent in all new manufacturing operations, including ongoing compliance with regulatory requirements, procurement and maintenance of construction, environmental and operational licenses and approvals for additional expansion, supply chain constraints, hiring, training and retention of qualified employees and the pace of bringing production equipment and processes online with the capability to manufacture high-quality units at scale. </li>
<li><strong>Additional funds </strong>: <co: 26>if Tesla cannot raise additional funds when it needs them, its financial condition, results of operations, business and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. Tesla may be negatively impacted by any early obsolescence of its manufacturing equipment. Tesla depreciates</li></ul>
