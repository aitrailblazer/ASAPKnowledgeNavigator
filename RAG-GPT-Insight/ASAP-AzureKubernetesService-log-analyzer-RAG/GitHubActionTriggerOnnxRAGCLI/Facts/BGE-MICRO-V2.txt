BGE-MICRO-V2 is a compact embedding model designed for generating dense vector representations of text. These embeddings are useful for tasks like clustering and semantic search. Due to its small size, BGE-MICRO-V2 is well-suited for deployment on devices with limited resources, offering fast inference times with a slight trade-off in accuracy compared to larger models.
